[zdone.co](https://www.zdone.co/) is a forgiving todo management system, specifically focused on recurring tasks. You set up a prioritization for all the things you do, and zdone will use that prioritization, along with data on how overdue a task is and how much time is left in the day, to select the tasks that are most important.

## Code
Much of the basics of the user login follow [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) by Miguel Grinberg. Looking at code examples from that tutorial will be helpful in understanding zdone code.

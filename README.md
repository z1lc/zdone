# zdone.co
[zdone.co](http://www.zdone.co/) is a forgiving todo management system, specifically focused on recurring tasks. You set up a prioritization for all the things you do on a recurring basis, and zdone will use that prioritization, along with data on how overdue a task is and how much time is left in the day, to tell you what you have left for today.

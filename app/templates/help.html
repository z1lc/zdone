<h1>Spotify + Anki Help</h1>

<h2>How to Import new Songs</h2>
Download the <a href="/spotify/download_apkg">latest set of songs</a> (be patient, this may take up to a minute). Open the file, and your new cards will appear under a deck called "Spotify Tracks."
<h2>How this app works</h2>
This app uses the concept of an "artist under management": this is an artist that you have decided you'd like to be familiar with. Once you add a selection of such artists, the app will automatically import the top 3 most-popular songs from their <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/features/artist-profile/">profile page</a>, as well as <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/what-is-your-music/">any songs that you've liked</a> from that artist.

<h2>How to Add a New Artist</h2>
While using the Spotify app, search for the artist you'd like to add and go to their artist page. Then, click follow. See below for a screenshot.<br>
